# Project Title

A Comprehensive Machine Learning Pipeline for Data Preprocessing, Training, and Evaluation using XGBoost

## Overview

This repository contains a series of Python scripts designed to create a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline. The pipeline covers the following key stages:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load, clean, and preprocess data.
2. **Model Training**: Train an XGBoost model using the preprocessed data.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model and log important metrics and plots.

## Requirements

The following Python packages are required to run the scripts:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`
- `dvclive`
- `pyyaml`

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
